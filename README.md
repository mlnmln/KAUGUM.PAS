# KAUGUM.PAS

> I found an old hard drive with a state machine in Pascal. This is a funny little rewrite in node / TypeScript. I wrote the original file in school in 1999.

The original code [contains a bug](https://github.com/mlnmln/KAUGUM.PAS/blob/master/doc/KAUGUM.PAS#L63), which kept as is. I also tried to ressemble the old programm structure as close as possible, but I needed to make a couple of adjustments. Turns out, procedural and impure programming is possible in TS :).
